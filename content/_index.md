        I am an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellow](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) working at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Supervised by Prof. [Stephen J. Pennycook](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnDfo6sAAAAJ&hl=en), my dissertation focused on using ML to efficiently identify quantum defects in atomic resolution STEM images. In my current postdoctoral role in Asist. Prof. [Duane Loh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnDfo6sAAAAJ&hl=en)â€™s group, I am interested in finding an efficient and explainable ML framework that describes a wide variety of important materials with disorder as a hierarchy of structural motifs.
