        I am an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellow](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS), specializing in the intersection of machine learning (ML) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Guided by Prof. [Stephen J. Pennycook](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnDfo6sAAAAJ&hl=en), my Ph.D. research innovatively applied ML to identify quantum defects in atomic resolution STEM images. Now in Asst. Prof. [Duane Loh](https://www.physics.nus.edu.sg/faculty/loh-duane/)'s group, I am advancing a robust ML framework to characterize materials through a hierarchy of structural motifs. Leveraging my deep expertise, I aim to develop an *electron microscope copilot system* to improve material analysis and enhance understanding of material disorders.

        ### What is Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy?
        **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)** is an advanced material characterization technique that uses a focused electron beam to scan thin samples, producing *atomic-resolution images*. Besides imaging, STEM can collect  *spectral data* to analyze material compositions and perform four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (*4DSTEM*), which captures diffraction patterns at each scan position.
