        I am an [Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellow](https://www.schmidtfutures.com/our-work/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) working at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Supervised by Prof. [Stephen J. Pennycook](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnDfo6sAAAAJ&hl=en), my dissertation focused on using ML to efficiently identify quantum defects in atomic resolution STEM images. In my current postdoctoral role in Asst. Prof. [Duane Loh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnDfo6sAAAAJ&hl=en)â€™s group, I am interested in finding an efficient and explainable ML framework that describes a wide variety of important materials with disorder as a hierarchy of structural motifs.

        ### What is Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy?
        ***Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)*** is an advanced material characterization technique that uses a focused electron beam to scan thin samples, producing atomic-resolution images. Besides imaging, STEM can collect spectral data to analyze material compositions and perform four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4DSTEM), which captures diffraction patterns at each scan position.
